# PyScript is here!
PyScript is a new JavaScript framework that lets users embed Python code in HTML documents. Furthermore, PyScript supports the Python scientific stack, including libraries like NumPy, pandas and scikit-learn, giving it significant potential for data science applications. The library was recently announced by Anaconda, Inc. and this is making me quite excited! Check the link below for more information, and let me know your thoughts in the comments.
