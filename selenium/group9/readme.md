Shopee and Lazada are two e-commerce platforms that customers are likely to consider when making an online purchase. As the two largest e-commerce sites that are operating in Malaysia, they are both excellent places to start looking for a deal. It is a common belief that, of the two e-commerce platforms in Malaysia, one is typically more affordable and caters to people who are looking for deals, while the other platform serves customers who are less concerned about prices.

This study will determine whether one of the e-commerce websites is in fact less expensive than the other. Using a Python script with Selenium and the Chrome web driver, we will automate the scraping process and generate our dataset. Here, we will be scraping the product's name and price. Then, we will perform some basic data analysis with Pandas on the scraped dataset. We will conclude the price comparison using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create a simple visual chart.<br>

  About Selenium
  <br>
</h2>
The term "Selenium" refers to a variety of open-source browser automation projects. It offers bindings for all significant programming languages, including Python, which is our preferred language. The WebDriver protocol is used by the Selenium API to control web browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Selenium has the ability to control both locally installed and remotely accessible browser instances.

The ability to handle websites naturally, like any browser will, is the main argument in favour of Selenium. It offers a wide variety of ways to interact with websites. This really excels when used with Single-Page Application sites that use a lot of JavaScript. If you used the conventional HTTP client and HTML parser to scrape such a site, you would mostly have a lot of JavaScript files but not a lot of data to scrape.
