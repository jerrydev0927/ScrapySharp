## Web-Scraping GE-15 by using Selenium
We will demonstrate a different method on web scraping by using Selenium. We have chosen a website that presents the winners of the latest General Election (GE-15). From this website, we would like to acquire the names of the candidates that won along with the seat they were constesting for and the amount of votes they won with.

<h2>About Selenium</h2>
<br>
Selenium is an open-source software suite of browser automation tools for controlling web browsers through programs and performing browser automation. It is widely used for testing web applications, automating repetitive tasks, and scraping data from websites.
<br>
<br>
Python, C#, Java, Perl, Ruby, and JavaScript are just a few of the scripting languages that are supported by the open source automation testing tool Selenium. One can select the script in accordance with the application that needs to be tested.
In addition, it is a Python library and utility for automating a variety of operations in web browsers. Web scraping is one method for obtaining relevant data and information that would not otherwise be available.
<br>
<br>
Overall, Selenium is a powerful and flexible tool that can greatly simplify and streamline the process of testing and automating web applications in Python.
<h2>Results</h2>
<br>
We used Selenium to sort all the candidates that won, their seat and the number of votes they won. We also added the column of which coalition they were under and their political party. The results can be seen at <a href = https://github.com/drshahizan/python-web/blob/main/selenium/SamVerse/PRU15_Results.csv>Dataset</a>
