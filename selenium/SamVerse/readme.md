## Web-Scraping E-commerce sites by using Selenium
We will demonstrate a different method on web scraping by using Selenium. We have chosen a website that presents the winners of the latest General Election (GE-15). From this website, we would get the names of the candidates that won along with the seat they were constesting for and the amount of votes they won with.

<h2>About Selenium</h2>
<br>
Python, C#, Java, Perl, Ruby, and JavaScript are just a few of the scripting languages that are supported by the open source automation testing tool Selenium. One can select the script in accordance with the application that needs to be tested.
In addition, it is a Python library and utility for automating a variety of operations in web browsers. Web scraping is one method for obtaining relevant data and information that would not otherwise be available.
<h2>Results</h2>
<br>
We used Selenium to sort all the candidates that won, their seat and the number of votes they won. We also added the column of which coalition they were under and their political party. The results can be seen at (https://github.com/drshahizan/python-web/blob/main/selenium/SamVerse/PRU15_Results.csv)
