yy
Scrapy is a Python web scraping framework. It provides a pre-defined set of methods and classes for crawling websites and extracting structured data, such as data for items like products, prices, reviews, etc. Scrapy is built on top of the Twisted asynchronous networking library, which means that it can handle large amounts of data and high concurrency without blocking the execution of the program.

Scrapy has several built-in features like:

Support for handling cookies and user-agents
Built-in support for handling redirects
Built-in support for handling forms
Built-in support for handling common HTTP status codes
Built-in support for extracting data from HTML and XML
Built-in support for generating CSV, JSON, or XML output
Scrapy is an open-source project, so you can use it for free and make any modifications you need. It is widely used for data mining, data extraction, and web scraping. You can use Scrapy to scrape data from websites, process it and store it in any format you want.
