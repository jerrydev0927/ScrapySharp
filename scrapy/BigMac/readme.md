**Introduction**
---
Scrapy is a Python web scraping framework. It provides a pre-defined set of methods and classes for crawling websites and extracting structured data, such as data for items like products, prices, reviews, etc. Scrapy is built on top of the Twisted asynchronous networking library, which means that it can handle large amounts of data and high concurrency without blocking the execution of the program.

In this assignment, we were ask to do some web scraping with the tool that we assigned on. We will try do do web scraping using scrapy on `CompAsia.com`. The data that we will be scraping are `product's name`, `price`, `discount` and `URL`. After that, data will be put in a dataframe and export to a .CSV file. The csv file can be found with the name [IphoneProduct.csv](https://github.com/drshahizan/python-web/blob/main/scrapy/BigMac/IphoneProduct.csv) file.

In conclusion, using scrapy for web scrapping is very benificial for extracting important information from the web. By doing so, only necessary details can be achieved
