Using requests library, we can fetch the content from the URL given and beautiful soup library helps to parse it and fetch the details the way we want. Requests library is the best choice if you just start with web scraping and have access to an API. It is easy to understand and does not require much practice to master. Requests also minimizes the need to include query strings in your URLs manually. It also supports authentication modules and handles cookies and sessions with excellent stability.
